      step 1: Open your website's "index.html" page.
      step 2: you will see <head> tag in the nested of <html> tag.
      step 3: copy this CDN
      
      ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-     9aIt2nRpC12Uk9gS9baDl411NQApFmC26EwAOH8WgZl5MYYxFfc+NcPb1dKGj7Sk" crossorigin="anonymous">'''
      step 4: Paste this CSS CDN in the top of </head> tag
  
  ### Javascript:
    * For pasting JavaScript in the body you have to follow bottom steps:
    
    Step 1: Scroll the bottom of your “index.html” file.
    
    Step 2: There you will see the body tag is closing. like </body>.
    
    Step 3: Copy the bottom scripts and past on the top of the </body> tag.
    
    ```<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
 ```

 ### Examples of using bootstrap CDN:
 
 ## 2.Download Bootstrap for offline:
    * First Download CDN's Directory and use by following steps
 Step 1:
     Go to Website [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/)
     
 Step 2:
      Select the version of bootstrap which you want to download.
      
 step 3:
      After selection of versions move on the right side of the header and click on the download button.
      
 step 4:
       Extract the bootstrap directory in local computer
       
 step 5:
       It Have many files in the folder from those you have to open the **dist** folder
       
 step 6:
       In the dist folder you will found two folders
                    1.CSS
                    2.JS
                    
step 7:
       In CSS Folder contains many files in that you have to select and copy **bootstrap.min.css** and paste that file in the project directory.
       
Step 8:
        Same like as CSS files there also js files in JS folder from there we will copy the bootstrap.min.js file and place this in project directory
        
       
       We have downloaded the directory of bootstrap 4.0. Now, we can implement these in our own index.html file. You have to do the same as we had to do in the online CDN method. add your directory path in the <head> tag and <body> tag.

Step 10: 
    Open the “Index.html” file.

Step 11: 
     <link rel=”stylesheet” href=”Here your file directory path”> copy this line and past in the top of </head> tag. This is for the “bootstrap.min.css” file.

Step 12: 
      We have pasted CSS file now Past Javascript in the top of </body> tag. for example <script src=”Here your file path”>. This is for the “bootstrap.min.js” file.
      
       
Note*:
   * If you are using Bootstrap directory online then this will actually access data from the bootstrap own directory. this will take time from retrieving data from there.
   
   * And if you are using the Bootstrap 4.0 directory from the download. then this will access data from your own directory. So this will easy to access data for your website
